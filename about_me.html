    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name’s Vincent, I was born on May 19, 1997, in a tiny little red dot, called Singapore. Currently a second
        year student in Singapore Institute of Management – University of Wollongong, pursuing a degree, Bachelor of
        Business Information Systems (BBIS).<br><br>

        I am actually half-thai, BUT to be frank, I can barely make up full sentences in thai. As a matter of fact, one
        of my new year’s resolution is to be fluent and comfortable in speaking the language, so that I can communicate
        with my distant relatives.</p>

    <h1>Why BBIS?</h1>
    <p>When I was little, I’ve always been interested in making money from the things that I like to do.<br><br>

        For example, back in primary school days, Orbeez were in trend, they were these tiny little water beads that are
        meant to keep moisture in soil for plants, but in our tiny little innocent 8 year old brains, we thought they
        were little water babies and they could multiply if we grow them together in a bunch. For me, I see this as an
        opportunity to take advantage of the demand to make some money. So, I would buy a big bag of these Orbeez, which
        costs about $2, grow them myself, and sell it to my peers in small packages for $1 each. Till this day, I can
        still remember how much I made from this side hustle, $32. It may not seem much, but for an 8 year old,
        surviving on a $1.50 fishball noodle from the canteen for lunch, I felt like a millionaire.<br><br>

        Years have passed, technology have advanced, slowly as I grew up, I got interested in Information Technology.
        Hence, I thought to myself, why not both? And here I am, pursuing my degree in Business Information Systems.</p>

    <h1>Life before University</h1>
    <p>Before university and the army, I was studying in Temasek Polytechnic, Infocomm and Network Engineering (INE).
        Ever since I was exposed to their Freshmen Orientation Camp, I was hooked.<br><br>

        Being able to make so much friends, have numerous gatherings and outings, it was countless amount of fun. Being
        a part of this also helped me open up so much, helped me improve my communication skills, leading skills and
        also a better person to work with in group environments.</p>

    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <p>Other than being trapped inside the four walls of my room, doing IT stuff, I also love going out for some fresh
        air. And by fresh air, I mean harsh cold wind with sand and debris flying straight into my face.<br><br>

        That’s right, I love bike riding. During my down time, I would venture out to different parts of Singapore,
        enjoy the smell of the air, cold wind caressing across my face and also not forgetting the adrenaline.<br><br>

        From this, you might think that I’d probably be an adrenaline junkie. But let me tell you a little secret, I’m
        actually not, I’m afraid of heights and rollercoasters, even the little pirate ship ride in night bazaars, don’t
        ask me how is bike riding different from all these, I have no idea.<br><br>

        So far these are the bikes that I’ve tried, would love to try out other kinds of bikes in the future, but my end
        goal would be owning a Harley Davidson in the future.<br><br>

        I wouldn’t say that I am a HUGE dog lover, but I do love them. I’ve got a little chihuahua, his name’s Pocky, I
        always see him as my little brother. As people always say, chihuahuas are like dogs but on drugs, well, they are
        not wrong.<br><br>

        I’d love to own a bigger sized dog in the future, like a dobermann. Don’t get me wrong, I love this little guy
        but this little crackhead will do for now.</p>
