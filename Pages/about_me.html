    <p>My name’s Vincent, I was born on May 19, 1997, in a tiny little red dot, called Singapore. Currently a second year student in Singapore Institute of Management – University of Wollongong, pursuing a degree, Bachelor of Business Information Systems (BBIS).

        I am actually half-thai, BUT to be frank, I can barely make up full sentences in thai. As a matter of fact, one of my new year’s resolution is to be fluent and comfortable in speaking the language, so that I can communicate with my distant relatives.</p>
