    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name’s Vincent, I was born on May 19, 1997, in a tiny little red dot, called Singapore. Currently a second
        year student in Singapore Institute of Management – University of Wollongong, pursuing a degree, Bachelor of
        Business Information Systems (BBIS).

        I am actually half-thai, BUT to be frank, I can barely make up full sentences in thai. As a matter of fact, one
        of my new year’s resolution is to be fluent and comfortable in speaking the language, so that I can communicate
        with my distant relatives.</p>

    <h1>Why BBIS?</h1>
    <p>When I was little, I’ve always been interested in making money from the things that I like to do.

        For example, back in primary school days, Orbeez were in trend, they were these tiny little water beads that are
        meant to keep moisture in soil for plants, but in our tiny little innocent 8 year old brains, we thought they
        were little water babies and they could multiply if we grow them together in a bunch. For me, I see this as an
        opportunity to take advantage of the demand to make some money. So, I would buy a big bag of these Orbeez, which
        costs about $2, grow them myself, and sell it to my peers in small packages for $1 each. Till this day, I can
        still remember how much I made from this side hustle, $32. It may not seem much, but for an 8 year old,
        surviving on a $1.50 fishball noodle from the canteen for lunch, I felt like a millionaire.

        Years have passed, technology have advanced, slowly as I grew up, I got interested in Information Technology.
        Hence, I thought to myself, why not both? And here I am, pursuing my degree in Business Information Systems.</p>
